launch SAMSUNG_USB_Driver_for_Mobile_Phones
to install drivers for android studio so it can detects your own
phone instead of the shitty emulator.
inside the android studio get to devices and click on devices
should look like gibrish first, click on it and it will send
a notification message to your phone to allow the pc to recognize it
allow it and it will work.
good luck.
